## Introduction
<p> Hello! You are now visiting my very first front-end project. It was initially developed with the intention to practice the knowledge I had just gained. However, I decided it would be a great idea if I made this my official professional portfolio! </p>
<p> It's expected to be updated every new project I start or whenever there be an improvement need. </p></br>
