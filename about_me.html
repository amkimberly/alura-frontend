            <p class="paragraph-content-presentation">My name is Amanda Marques, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree
                in Computer Science in Brazil. Additionally, I am an international student studying Web Development in Australia 
                until April 2025. This international experience has provided me with a global perspective and a diverse set of skills.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content-presentation">I have gained practical experience as a Junior Ruby on Rails Developer in a Brazilian startup, 
                where I contributed to web development projects and sharpened my coding skills. Additionally, I have spent a year working as a Requirements
                 Analyst, allowing me to develop a strong understanding of software requirements and effective communication with stakeholders.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content-presentation">Regarding my technological focus, I am currently dedicated to mastering a range of front-end 
                development technologies. These include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React. I am passionate about creating engaging and 
                intuitive user interfaces, and I believe that these technologies provide the foundation for building exceptional web applications.</p>
